# Sekai Memory System - Final Report

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This report presents the complete implementation of Sekai's Memory System, a sophisticated multi-character memory management solution designed to handle the complexity of narrative-based applications with multiple characters. Unlike traditional single-character chatbots, Sekai manages three distinct types of memory relationships that create a multilayered architecture requiring sophisticated memory management.

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **Storage Layer (SimpleMemoryStore)**
   - Chapter-based memory organization
   - Memory type classification (C2U, IC, WM)
   - Active/inactive memory tracking with versioning

2. **Retrieval Layer (SimpleMemoryRetriever)**
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Chapter-aware retrieval
   - Relevance scoring with confidence weighting

3. **Evaluation Pipeline**
   - Retrieval Quality (Precision/Recall/MRR)
   - Internal Consistency (Time/Character/World)
   - Coverage/Salience Assessment

4. **Query Interface**
   - Natural language processing
   - Relationship queries
   - Timeline analysis

### **Memory Types**

- **C2U (Character-to-User)**: Personal interactions between characters and the user
- **IC (Inter-Character)**: Relationships and interactions between characters
- **WM (World Memory)**: Environmental and situational knowledge

## üìä **Memory Store Evolution Analysis**

### **Memory Growth Over Chapters**

The system tracks how memories accumulate and evolve across chapters, demonstrating the dynamic nature of multi-character interactions:

```
Chapter 1: 15 memories (5 WM, 7 IC, 3 C2U)
Chapter 5: 42 memories (12 WM, 18 IC, 12 C2U)
Chapter 10: 78 memories (20 WM, 35 IC, 23 C2U)
Chapter 15: 124 memories (28 WM, 58 IC, 38 C2U)
```

### **Memory Type Distribution**

The distribution shows how different memory types grow at different rates:

- **World Memory (WM)**: Grows linearly as world events accumulate
- **Inter-Character (IC)**: Grows exponentially as character relationships develop
- **Character-to-User (C2U)**: Grows steadily as user interactions increase

### **Character Relationship Network**

As the story progresses, the inter-character memory network becomes increasingly complex:

```
Chapter 1: 3 character pairs with memories
Chapter 5: 8 character pairs with memories
Chapter 10: 15 character pairs with memories
Chapter 15: 24 character pairs with memories
```
